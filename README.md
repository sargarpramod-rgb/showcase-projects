   -- After checking out the project navigate to directory having react code.
   -- install any missing modules with npm install and start the project using npm start

   -- If required, update path of javascript and css in index.html before starting springboot app.
      e.g. from href="/static/css/main.e6c13ad2.css" to href="/css/main.e6c13ad2.css"
